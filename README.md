Connect to the Azure Service Bus.

This connector gives you access to the Azure Service Bus. It allows to
define multiple sending and receiving connections to queues and topics.

Additionally, this connector provides an `IProcessStartEventBean` which
can be used to start Ivy processes which react on Azure Service Bus
messages.
